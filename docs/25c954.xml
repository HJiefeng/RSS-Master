                    Apple plans to mostly stop announcing new features more than a few months before they are ready to launch, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett</a>. The pair of reporters revealed this noteworthy tidbit towards the bottom of a lengthy report about Apple's artificial intelligence shortcomings today.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994536" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.jpg" width="1600" />
<br />
This alleged change in strategy comes after Apple was forced to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delay its more personalized version of Siri</a>, which will be powered by Apple Intelligence. Apple first previewed the promised Siri upgrades during its WWDC 2024 keynote, and at the time it said the features would be available within the following year.
<br />

<br />
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-removes-2024-from-next-gen-carplay-page/">missed its promised 2024 timeframe</a> for launching next-generation CarPlay, which it first announced all the way back at WWDC 2022. The company finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">announced the launch of CarPlay Ultra</a> last week, with the software system rolling out in high-end Aston Martin vehicles in the U.S. and Canada this month.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/18/apple-to-cut-down-on-early-announcements/">Apple Will Reportedly Be More Cautious About Announcing New Features Well in Advance</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-will-reportedly-be-more-cautious-about-announcing-new-features-well-in-advance.2457300/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                    Apple is planning to give users in the EU the ability to set a default voice assistant other than Siri, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett</a>.

<br />
In a lengthy report about Apple's artificial intelligence shortcomings today, Gurman and Bennett said Apple plans to introduce this change across multiple software platforms, which likely means the iPhone, iPad, and Mac at a minimum.
<br />

<br />
Presumably, this means that users in the EU will be able to set options like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant as their default voice assistant on Apple devices.
<br />

<br />
Apple is working on this change in response to expanding EU regulations, the report said.
<br />

<br />
Apple already lets iPhone users in the EU set third-party apps as the default option <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/ios-18-2-default-apps-section/">for browsing and messaging</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/ios-18-4-eu-users-set-google-maps-as-default-app/">navigation</a>, and much more.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/18/apple-to-let-eu-users-switch-away-from-siri/">Apple Will Reportedly Let iPhone Users in the EU Switch Away From Siri</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-will-reportedly-let-iphone-users-in-the-eu-switch-away-from-siri.2457299/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                    Amazon is hosting a big collection of discounts across multiple Apple products this weekend, including notable deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, Apple Pencil Pro, and MacBook Air.
<br />

<br />
<h2>AirPods</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998407" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/airpods-max-blue.jpeg" width="2500" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>
<br />

<br />
Amazon has the USB-C AirPods Max for &#36;479.99 in Starlight, down from &#36;549.00. This is a solid second-best price on the headphones, and it's been a few months since we last tracked an all-time low price, so if you've been waiting for a deal this is a good time to buy.
<br />

<br />
Similarly, the AirPods Pro 2 are on sale on Amazon for &#36;188.56, which is another second-best price.
<br />

<br />

<br />
For Apple Watches, you can get &#36;100 off two models of the Series 10. This sale was much more extensive earlier in the month, but there are still a few discounts remaining on both the 42mm and 46mm GPS models.

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    Apple surprised us this week with the official launch of its more advanced "CarPlay Ultra" feature to provide greatly expanded functionality in cars, while the company also released iOS 18.5 and related operating system updates.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002004" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/top-stories-2025-05-17.jpg" width="1600" />
<br />
This week also saw Apple's annual announcement of upcoming accessibility features for its products while we looked ahead to what else is coming at WWDC next month, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!
<br />

<br />
<h2>Apple's 'CarPlay Ultra' Experience Now Available</h2>
<br />
Nearly three years after Apple announced the next-generation version of CarPlay with deeper vehicle integration, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">CarPlay Ultra is finally here</a> — if you can afford an Aston Martin. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/carplay-ultra-committed-automakers/">Many other brands</a>, including new additions Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis, are working on support, however, so availability should significantly expand over time.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002002" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/CarPlay-Ultra-Thumb-1.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
‌CarPlay‌ Ultra is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/first-look-at-carplay-ultra/">designed to bring a consistent look and feel to the entire driving experience</a>. It integrates more directly with the vehicle to provide information on all of the driver's screens, featuring real-time content and gauges in the instrument cluster with options for the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, and more. Drivers can choose to display information from the iPhone, such as maps and media, alongside information from the vehicle, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 18.5 With New Wallpaper, Screen Time Changes, Carrier Satellite Support for iPhone 13 and More</h2>
<br />
As expected, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-ios-18-5/">Apple this week released iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5</a>, relatively minor updates with only a few changes, feature additions, and bug fixes.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999304" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iOS-18.5-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
Related <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-macos-sequoia-15-5/">macOS Sequoia 15.5</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-watchos-11-5/">watchOS 11.5</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-tvos-18-5/">tvOS 18.5</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-visionos-2-5/">visionOS 2.5</a> updates were also released this week, and we're expecting at least one more round of x.6 updates to the current major operating system versions as Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 and friends at WWDC next month.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Apple Preparing to Launch Mind-Control Support for iPhones</h2>
<br />
It sounds like science fiction, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/apple-preparing-to-launch-mind-control-support/">Apple is indeed working with neurotechnology startup Synchron</a> to allow users with severe motor impairments to control their devices via neural signals detected by an implantable brain-computer device called the Stentrode.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001393" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-19-Accessibility-Feature.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
The news comes as Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/apple-previews-ios-19-accessibility-features/">announced a wide range of new accessibility features</a> coming to its products later this year. Based on previous patterns, most of these new and improved features will come with iOS 19 and related updates.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Top Five Announcements to Look Forward to at WWDC 2025</h2>
<br />
Time sure flies, and we're now less than a month away from the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference where Apple will introduce new software updates. Rumors are picking up ahead of the event, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/wwdc-top-five-features/">we thought we'd highlight some of the updates</a> that we're looking forward to learning more about.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001635" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/WWDC25-One-Month-Thumb-1.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
WWDC 2025 will begin with a keynote event on June 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple will have a live stream available, but we'll also be providing coverage here on MacRumors.com and through the MacRumorsLive Twitter account for those who aren't able to watch.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Apple Acquisition Hints at Upgraded Calendar App on iOS 19 or Beyond</h2>
<br />
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/apple-acquired-mayday-labs/">acquired Canadian startup Mayday Labs</a> in April 2024, according to a European Commission listing recently spotted by French blog MacGeneration.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001144" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Mayday-Calendar.jpg" width="1600" />
<br />
Mayday Labs had developed an AI-powered calendar, task manager, and scheduling assistant for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The all-in-one app used AI to automatically schedule your events and tasks at ideal times, and it could learn your scheduling preferences and daily patterns over time to further optimize your calendar.
<br />

<br />
It would be reasonable to assume that some of Mayday's features and technologies could be added to Apple's Calendar app across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, under the Apple Intelligence umbrella.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Apple Music Gets New Transfer Tool to Make Switching From Spotify Easier</h2>
<br />
Apple this week introduced a new feature designed to allow prospective Apple Music users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/apple-music-transfer-tool/">import their saved music and playlists from third-party music services to ‌Apple Music‌</a>.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962031" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-music.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
The feature is either in an expanded testing phase or it has started rolling out, and it is available in Australia and New Zealand according to an Apple Support document.
<br />

<br />
Apple is partnering with SongShift for the new ‌Apple Music‌ feature. SongShift is an app that transfers music playlists across streaming platforms, but by working with Apple, the functionality has been integrated directly in the ‌Apple Music‌ app.
<br />

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    2027 will mark the 20th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and Apple is planning to celebrate with an all-new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design. With the 10th anniversary of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple unveiled the all-display &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X with no bezels at the top or the bottom for the camera or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> home button. It marked the debut of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, and dictated the next decade of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001660" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/All-Screen-iPhone-2027-Feature-1.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
For the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XX," Apple needs to do even better, and rumors suggest that the company has some big ideas that it's aiming for.
<br />

<br />
Apple wants to create an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-design/">all-glass iPhone</a> that doesn't have cutouts in the display, so there could be a high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19 Pro model that fulfills that requirement. Apple wants a true <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-report/">edge-to-edge display</a>
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<br />
The 20th anniversary &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple is planning for 2027 could feature a radical design, offering a display that has no visible frame or bezels. An early rumor suggests that Apple is aiming for a display that curves around all four edges of the device, for a borderless visual experience.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793994" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Triad.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
Apple wants a mostly glass &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a curved display and no cutouts, which would necessitate under-display &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; and an under-display camera.
<br />

<br />
An all-glass &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a wraparound display that covers all four edges of the device would be less durable than current &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models that have titanium or aluminum frames, so Apple may need to come up with more durable glass before such a device is a possibility.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="battery">Battery</h2>
<br />
Apple is developing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/2027-iphone-game-changing-silicon-battery/">new battery technology</a> that could make it into the 2027 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models. Apple is looking into using pure silicon anode batteries, which are able to store more lithium ions per gram than current batteries, resulting in significant increases in battery life without major increases in battery size.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2>
<br />
Apple could use advanced AI memory technology for the 2027 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models. Apple is rumored to be considering Mobile High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), a type of DRAM that stacks memory chips vertically and connects them through tiny vertical interconnects to boost signal transmission speeds.
<br />

<br />
In smartphones, the technology would provide high data throughput while minimizing power consumption and the physical footprint of RAM dies.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<br />
Technically, the 20th anniversary &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup would be the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19 lineup, but in 2017, Apple released a surprise "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X" alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 models. This year, Apple could have similar plans for the high-end device, though what it might be called is unclear.
<br />

<br />
Apple could decide to call it the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 20, like the decision it made for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X in 2017, or the company could stick with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19 naming. Alternatively, the all-display device could have an entirely new name, like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-ultra/">iPhone Ultra</a>.
<br />

<br />
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple has planned could be a replacement for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro models, or it could be sold alongside them. With plans for a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2026, though, it may not make sense to add yet another phone to the lineup.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2>
<br />
The 20th anniversary &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; would presumably come out in the fall of 2027.<br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/20th-anniversary-iphone/">Apple&#039;s 20th Anniversary iPhone: What We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-20th-anniversary-iphone-what-we-know-so-far.2457232/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    Last week, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-safety-tools/">shared a list of iPhone safety tools</a> that every <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owner should know about, from Emergency SOS and Medical ID to Safety Check and Check In. <em>MacRumors</em> readers <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/six-iphone-safety-tools-you-should-know-about.2456810/post-33900031">had more suggestions</a> on safety information we should highlight, so we have a follow-up.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001168" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-Safety-Feature.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
<h2 id="you_dont_need_a_sim_to_call_emergency_services">You Don't Need a SIM to Call Emergency Services</h2>
<br />
If you have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with no SIM inside and no cellular service, you can still use it to call emergency services in the United States, Canada, and Australia.
<br />

<br />
When emergency services are dialed on a smartphone with no SIM, it will automatically connect to any carrier network that's available, no questions asked. If you have an old &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, it's worth keeping it charged up and available as a spare in case you ever need it in an emergency.
<br />

<br />
You'll see "SOS" or "SOS only" in the status bar if you're able to use an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with no SIM for an emergency call.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="you_dont_need_signal_to_call_emergency_services">You Don't Need Signal to Call Emergency Services</h2>
<br />
Likewise, if you have no signal and you're in an emergency situation, try dialing emergency services anyway. Even if your carrier doesn't have signal where you are, there could be another carrier that does, and you can automatically use that network.
<br />

<br />
If you see "SOS" or "SOS only" in the status bar on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, it means you don't have a signal with your carrier, but you can still use another carrier to make an emergency call. If your phone says No Service or Searching, there is no nearby cellular network to connect to for an emergency call.
<br />

<br />
If you're in a remote or rural area with no carrier signal from any carrier, you may be able to use Emergency SOS via satellite on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 or later model to place to get help in an emergency.
<br />

<br />
Your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will let you know that a satellite connection is available whenever you're out of cellular or Wi-Fi range. Using Emergency SOS via Satellite typically requires a clear view of the sky for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to establish a connection.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="emergency_services_and_your_location">Emergency Services and Your Location</h2>
<br />
When you place an emergency call, your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is able to automatically relay your location to emergency services in the United States.
<br />

<br />
It does this through a feature called HELO, or Hybridized Emergency Location, which Apple has supported since 2015. HELO uses cell towers and on-device data points like GPS and Wi-Fi to estimate a 911 caller's location.
<br />

<br />
Location information is relayed through a software system provided by RapidSOS that 911 centers use, and it's how emergency personnel can find you when you call from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.
<br />

<br />
<h3 id="wi-fi_calling">Wi-Fi Calling</h3>
<br />
If you're using Wi-Fi calling, you've probably been prompted to enter an Emergency Address. This is so you can be located if you're calling using a Wi-Fi connection. You'll want to make sure your Emergency Address is up to date if Wi-Fi calling is a feature that you use.
<br />

<br />
You can update your Emergency Address by going to the Settings app, navigating to the Apps section, choosing Phone, tapping on Wi-Fi calling, and then tapping on Update Emergency Address. Apple says you should update your address whenever you change your location.
<br />

<br />
911 calls will only be placed over Wi-Fi if a cellular network is unavailable, so it's not the default option. When Wi-Fi calling is available, you'll see Wi-Fi in the status bar.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="you_can_text_911">You Can Text 911</h2>
<br />
In the United States and some other countries, you can text 911 if making a phone call isn't an option. To do so, open the Messages app, type in your emergency services number, and then type your emergency in the text message field.
<br />

<br />
When you text 911, your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; goes into an emergency mode for a 30 minute period, and to exit it, you'll need to restart.
<br />

<br />
Texting 911 is available on iPhones running iOS 13 or later, and you can also text on an Apple Watch with watchOS 6 or later. Texting 911 requires a cellular connection.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="you_can_send_video_to_911">You Can Send Video to 911</h2>
<br />
As of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, there is an option to share streaming video and recorded media with 911 operators during emergency calls. When you call 911, emergency dispatchers can send a request to share live video or photos over a secure connection.
<br />

<br />
The ability to share photos and video with emergency services is available thanks to Apple's partnerships with RapidSOS and Prepared.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="carrier_satellite_services_vs._apple_emergency_sos_via_satellite">Carrier Satellite Services vs. Apple Emergency SOS via Satellite</h2>
<br />
On the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 and all later &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, there is a built-in Apple-provided satellite connectivity feature that can be used for emergency situations, texting, and updating your location when Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity are not available.
<br />

<br />
Separately, some carriers <em>also</em> offer satellite connectivity, and this is distinct from Emergency SOS via Satellite. Apple and cellular carriers haven't done a great job making the distinction between Emergency SOS via Satellite and carrier-provided satellite services, so there can be some confusion.
<br />

<br />
To use Emergency SOS via Satellite, you need an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 or later, and you need to use Apple's satellite services provided by Globalstar. Emergency SOS via Satellite is the default on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it will show up when you do not have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.
<br />

<br />
With carrier services, what's available varies by carrier, and it comes into play if you have an older &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or are in an area where you can't get connectivity through one of Globalstar's satellites. Most carrier satellite services right now are provided through Starlink, and with Starlink, you can text over satellite, but not call.
<br />

<br />
If you have T-Mobile in the U.S., au in Japan, or One NZ in New Zealand, you have access to Starlink satellite connectivity. In an emergency, if Starlink is what you can connect to, you will need to text emergency services by typing 911 (or your local emergency number) in the Messages app. Starlink may support calls and data in the future, but it does not at the current time.
<br />

<br />
When you see mentions of Emergency SOS and satellite calls on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in news stories, commercials, and other places, it is referencing the built-in satellite option available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 and later.
<br />

<br />
Carrier satellite services are now supported on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 and later, so if you have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 model, you may be able to text emergency services using carrier satellite services when you have no signal, but you can't use Emergency SOS via Satellite.
<br />

<br />
Carrier satellite services may be included in some plans or could cost extra in some situations, and it varies from carrier to carrier.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="siri_health_integration">Siri Health Integration</h2>
<br />
For a long time now, Apple has partnered with the Suicide Prevention Lifeline to direct customers who may be feeling down to the hotline to get help. If you tell <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> you're thinking of suicide, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will suggest that you call and will offer to dial for you.
<br />

<br />
Telling &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; you're depressed will prompt &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to offer to call a friend, family member, or NHS.uk.
<br />

<br />
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; also integrates with other services. If you've been sexually assaulted, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will offer to call the National Sexual Assault Hotline. If you've been abused, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will offer to call the National Domestic Abuse Hotline.
<br />

<br />
You can ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to dial 911 (or your local emergency number) if you're not able to. In the U.S., &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can also dial 988 to reach the National Suicide Prevention and Crisis Hotline.

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. GRID Studio is known for taking non-operational Apple devices that would be cluttering up a landfill and turning them into <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/collections/all">stylish art for Apple fans</a>.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002007" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/grid-studio-iphone-2g.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
GRID Studio takes apart iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple accessories, cleverly displaying each component to provide a look inside Apple's most iconic products. The pieces are arranged in a frame and accompanied by labels and little tidbits of Apple history.
<br />

<br />
The company is offering a flash sale this weekend, with up to 50 percent off a range of products. The GRID 1, featuring the <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">well-known first-generation iPhone</a>, for example, is available for &#36;299, which is a &#36;100 discount off of the typical price.
<br />

<br />
The original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is one of Apple's most recognizable devices, and it is the ideal piece to get because it was such an important part of Apple's history. The GRID 1 features all of the internal components from the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, from the home button to the chassis.
<br />

<br />
For something more affordable, the <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-6plus">GRID 6 Plus</a>, featuring the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 Plus, is just &#36;99 during the sale. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 Plus was Apple's first larger-sized &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, sold alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6. It is perhaps best known for being the subject of the major "bendgate" controversy because the chassis could become distorted in a pocket.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002008" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/grid-studio-iphone-6-plus.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
The GRID 13, <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-13">available for &#36;179</a>, features Apple's more modern &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13. The GRID 13 shows off the newer, flat-edged chassis that Apple introduced with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, a logic board with the A15 chip, and a range of components like the Taptic Engine and the TrueDepth camera system.
<br />

<br />

<br />
GRID Studio does accessories too, such as the Magic Mouse. A disassembled version of the Magic Mouse <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/grid-magic-mouse">is on sale for &#36;99</a>, and it feature's Apple's love it or hate it mouse design.
<br />

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    Apple today clarified that it has not blocked <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> from updating the iOS Fortnite app in the European Union, but it is not planning to allow &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; to offer Fortnite in the United States <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> at the current time.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754674" height="1204" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg" width="2140" />
<br />
In a statement to <em><a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1923404412090782109">Bloomberg</a></em>, Apple said that &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; tied its U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; submission to the update that was also being submitted to the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store for iOS in the European Union. Apple told &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; to resubmit the update without the U.S. component.
<br />
<blockquote>We asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the US storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies. We did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces in the EC.</blockquote>
<br />
This morning, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; claimed that Apple blocked its Fortnite submission worldwide. "Apple blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; or to the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store for iOS in the European Union," <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923293522234356169">Epic Games said</a>. The company went on to claim that Fortnite on iOS will be "offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it."
<br />

<br />
Given Apple's clarification, it sounds like &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; has decided to take Fortnite offline in the European Union rather than submitting an update that does not include Fortnite for the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. By tying the updates together and suggesting Apple is denying Fortnite's distribution worldwide, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; could rally lawmakers and customers to push back at Apple's attempt to "block" Fortnite in the U.S.
<br />

<br />
Fortnite gets weekly updates, and the updates need to go out for all platforms at the same time. Apple didn't remove Fortnite from the iOS &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store in the European Union, but by denying the Fortnite submission, the EU version of the game won't get the update on time. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; could remove the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; version of Fortnite from its app submission in order to update the EU version and keep it functional, but it's not yet clear if Epic plans to do so.
<br />

<br />
Fortnite has been banned from the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; since 2020, and &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; does not have a valid U.S. developer account. Last year, to distribute Fortnite in the European Union using an alternative app marketplace, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; created a subsidiary, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Sweden. Because &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; has no U.S. developer account, the company used &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Sweden to submit Fortnite to the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.
<br />

<br />
In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a> lawsuit, Apple was at no point forced to allow Fortnite back in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and it was made clear that Apple does not have an obligation to distribute Fortnite.
<br />

<br />
&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; CEO Tim Sweeney said ahead of Apple's decision that he would be "very surprised" if Apple "decided to brave the geopolitical storm of blocking a major app from iOS," but the reality is that Fortnite hasn't been available through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; for the last five years.
<br />

<br />
Apple was recently ordered to change its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules to allow developers to direct customers to purchase options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in the U.S., which is why &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; thought it would be able to bring Fortnite back to the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, but Apple is upholding the ban. There is nothing in the order that changes the situation with Fortnite.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/">Fortnite</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/apple-fortnite-ios-not-blocked-worldwide/">Apple Says Fortnite for iOS Isn&#039;t Blocked Worldwide, Just the U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-fortnite-for-ios-isnt-blocked-worldwide-just-the-u-s.2457214/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

Apple says that some users may be experiencing issues with &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, Apple Cash, &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, or Wallet, and there are multiple complaints on social media sites about &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; and other features not working.

Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">announced CarPlay Ultra</a>, its next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; experience. &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra fully extends across all of the vehicle's displays, including the instrument cluster. It provides access to real-time vehicle data, supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> widgets, theme options, instrument cluster display customizations, and introduces integrations for vehicle functions.
<br />

&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra is available first in new Aston Martin models in North America. Existing Aston Martin vehicles will also support &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra through forthcoming software updates. Looking ahead, Apple says it has secured commitments from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis to bring &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra to their vehicles in the coming year. Other automakers are expected to follow.

In other news, Samsung this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-2/">announced the Galaxy S25 Edge</a> — a device clearly designed to undercut the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;'s expected appeal, with both smartphones aiming to be the thinnest in their respective ecosystems.
<br />

<br />
The Galaxy S25 Edge sports a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, a titanium frame, and a remarkably slim 5.8mm profile, weighing in at just 163 grams. It features a dual-lens camera system, including a 200MP wide-angle sensor and a 12MP ultra-wide camera, supported by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. Samsung is also pushing its AI credentials with features like Drawing Assist and Audio Eraser.
<br />

<br />
In contrast, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; is rumored to be even thinner at just 5.5mm, making it Apple's slimmest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; ever. It is expected to feature a 6.6-inch OLED display with ProMotion. Apple is said to be removing the ultra-wide camera entirely and opting for a single 48MP wide camera, removing the SIM card tray, and the secondary stereo speaker to save internal space. Other expected specifications include a 24MP front-facing camera, 12GB of RAM, and the A19 chip.
<br />

<br />
While the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; may win the title of thinnest flagship, it could come with a major compromise: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/iphone-17-air-battery-life-rumors/">battery life</a>. According to internal testing leaks, only 60–70% of users are expected to get through a full day on a single charge — a notable drop from the 80–90% seen with other recent &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models. Apple is reportedly using a higher-density battery and its custom C1 modem to squeeze as much efficiency as possible into the super-thin design. 
<br />

<br />
To address this, Apple is reportedly developing a new USB-C battery case, designed to extend the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;'s runtime. The accessory could launch alongside the device to help mitigate negative perceptions around longevity. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.

                    The upcoming all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air could become the first Apple smartphone to adopt advanced battery technology, with Japanese supplier TDK preparing to ship its new generation of silicon-anode batteries by the end of June.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999629" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Air-Pastel-Feature.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
According to <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250516VL201/tdk-iphone-silicon-production-component.html">DigiTimes</a></em>, TDK CEO Noboru Saito revealed in a recent interview that the Apple supplier has accelerated its production timeline, moving shipments forward from the originally planned September quarter. That may give smartphone makers enough time to use the cells in thinner models launching this year, he suggested.
<br />

<br />
"We've made good progress, and we're shipping them very soon," Saito said, adding that "some handset makers might be able to use the new battery in their product one generation early."
<br />

<br />
The timing could be soon enough for Apple's expected September launch of the iPhone 17 Air, which is rumored to measure just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">5.5mm at its thinnest point</a>, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
<br />

<br />
TDK's batteries use silicon for anodes instead of the traditional graphite, allowing them to pack 15% more energy into the same space compared to conventional rechargeable battery packs. This advancement could be key to maintaining adequate battery life in such a slim form factor.
<br />

<br />
Having said that, reports have been mixed regarding the iPhone 17 Air's potential battery performance. While <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma claimed the device will have "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">worse</a>" battery life compared to previous iPhone models, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman offered a more optimistic outlook, stating that battery life would be "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/">on par with current iPhones</a>" thanks to hardware and software optimizations.
<br />

<br />
Further supporting the possibility of decent battery life, Kuo recently mentioned in a blog post that the iPhone 17 Air will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/iphone-17-air-high-density-battery-rumor/">"high-density" battery</a>, although he didn't elaborate.
<br />

<br />
The device is also rumored to incorporate Apple's power-efficient C1 modem and lack an Ultra Wide camera, potentially providing more internal space for a larger battery.
<br />

<br />
Looking further ahead, a recent report from <em>ETNews</em> has suggested that Apple could adopt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/2027-iphone-game-changing-silicon-battery/">advanced silicon battery technology</a> for its 2027 iPhone, marking the 20th anniversary of the iconic device. The next-generation battery could theoretically use pure silicon anodes, which can store up to 10 times more lithium ions per gram than current materials.
<br />

<br />
TDK is already working on its fourth-generation silicon batteries, according to the company's CEO. "We plan to introduce fourth-generation silicon batteries sometime in the next fiscal year to widen our lead even further," said Saito, claiming that "mass-producing silicon batteries requires special know-how. It's not like you can do it by just putting the materials together."
<br />

<br />
The 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air is expected to replace the Plus model in Apple's 2025 lineup, and is likely to be announced in September, per Apple's typical fall release schedule.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/iphone-17-air-advanced-silicon-battery/">iPhone 17 Air Could Debut Advanced Silicon Battery Tech</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-could-debut-advanced-silicon-battery-tech.2457204/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    Apple's Vision Pro headset has left many early adopters expressing dissatisfaction over its weight, limited use cases, and sparse software ecosystem, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/they-paid-3-500-for-apples-vision-pro-a-year-later-it-still-hurts-496de341">new article from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898839" height="897" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-video-recording.jpg" width="1595" />
<br />
In the year following the device's launch, user feedback suggests that it has failed to meet expectations for comfort, software support, and social acceptance. In interviews conducted by <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, early buyers of the Vision Pro reported that the device now sits largely unused due to a range of practical issues. Dustin Fox, a real estate agent in Centreville, Virginia, said:
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>It's just collecting dust. I think I've probably used it four times in the last year.
<br />

<br />
It's way too heavy. I can't wear it for more than 20 or 30 minutes without it hurting my neck.</blockquote>  
<br />

<br />
He explained that he was initially drawn to the device's novelty and potential productivity benefits, but found the physical experience of wearing the headset unsustainable for extended sessions. The Vision Pro weighs approximately 600 to 650 grams (1.3 to 1.4 pounds), depending on the light seal and headband configuration. This is considerably heavier than typical head-mounted consumer electronics, and the front-heavy distribution has become a recurring complaint.
<br />

<br />
Tovia Goldstein, a 24-year-old based in New York City, said that his experience watching content on the headset was also limited by discomfort and an insufficient number of apps to make it worthwhile.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>After 60 minutes, you can't, you just have to throw it down. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it, unless you're really rich and you don't know what to do with your money.</blockquote>  
<br />

<br />
When he retrieves the device to investigate any new apps that have been added to the visionOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, he noted the lengthy startup time as a deterrent, citing the need to connect the external battery and wait several minutes before the device is ready to use.
<br />

<br />
The Vision Pro debuted with high visibility, including a flagship store event in New York City attended by Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>. In the weeks following the launch, users were spotted wearing the headset in public spaces such as malls, restaurants, and sports events, but several buyers said that public enthusiasm quickly diminished.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>People were excited to be wearing it. Then it just died.
<br />

<br />
[...]
<br />

<br />
I feel total regret.</blockquote>  
<br />

<br />
Fox said that he considered selling his Vision Pro, but resale values had fallen significantly below the original price. 
<br />

<br />
Another early adopter, Anshel Sag, a technology analyst based in San Diego, used the Vision Pro for inflight entertainment but eventually abandoned it due to social discomfort and practicality issues.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>I got pretty dirty looks from people. I don't need that.
<br />

<br />
It takes up like half of the volume of my carry-on.</blockquote>  
<br />

<br />
The Vision Pro's travel case, sold separately for &#36;199, is also large; it measures in at roughly 12 inches by 9 inches by 6.5 inches.
<br />

<br />
Anthony Racaniello, a media studio operator from Philadelphia, attempted to use the headset in the workplace and during air travel but experienced both social alienation and practical challenges. During one nearly six-hour flight, he said a flight attendant ignored him during beverage service.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>You look like you have a sleep mask on. And people are going to treat you that way.
<br />

<br />
The best compliment I got was a light chuckle and "It looks like you're wearing ski goggles at work."</blockquote>  
<br />

<br />
He later sold his Vision Pro for &#36;1,900 — a 46% loss from the original purchase price — and said he did not miss it.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>It's definitely a glimpse at the future. I just think it's a ways away from there. For now, you have to put on what feels like a 500-pound MacBook Pro, strap it to your face and have people laugh at you.</blockquote>  
<br />

<br />
Yam Olisker, a 20-year-old YouTuber from Israel, flew to New York to purchase the Vision Pro at launch and obtained &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj;'s signature on both his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the Vision Pro box.
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>This is the first time, ever, that I've thought an Apple product was just a bit early, or ahead of its time. I use it much less than I expected.
<br />
</blockquote>  
<br />

<br />
That being said, he does not regret the purchase and enjoys watching movies with his Vision Pro, especially 3D films like <em>Metallica</em>, which he said makes it feel "like you're at the concert." Nevertheless, the weight remains an issue, and he has to lie in bed to mitigate its effect when watching movies.
<br />

<br />
Although Apple's work on a substantially enhanced Vision Pro model has apparently stalled, there are strong indications that the company will release "an incremental update to the product with limited changes to its physical design," such as a chip upgrade, according to <em>The Information</em>. Corroborating this, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> have said that a more iterative second-generation Vision Pro is in active development, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">adding the M5 chip</a> and little else.
<br />

<br />
This updated model is expected to reuse most of its components from the first-generation Vision Pro to offset the surplus inventory in Apple's supply chain. Gurman said the refreshed device could launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/vision-pro-2-with-m5-may-not-launch-until-2026/">between fall 2025 and spring 2026</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/">The Wall Street Journal</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/vision-pro-buyers-feel-total-regret/">WSJ: Some Apple Vision Pro Buyers &#039;Feel Total Regret&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wsj-some-apple-vision-pro-buyers-feel-total-regret.2457201/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                    Apple has been named the most valuable global brand for the fourth consecutive year, according to the 2025 edition of Kantar's <a href="https://www.kantar.com/campaigns/brandz/global">BrandZ report</a>, with its brand now valued at &#36;1.29 trillion — a year-over-year increase of 28%.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-844498" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/apple-park-sunset.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
The latest <a href="https://www.kantar.com/campaigns/brandz/global">Kantar BrandZ Global Top 100 ranking</a> assigns Apple the top position in a comprehensive analysis of brand performance, marking a continued upward trend for the company. Kantar's valuation methodology combines financial performance with brand perception, incorporating insights from over 4.5 million consumer interviews across 522 categories in 54 markets.
<br />

<br />
According to the report, Apple's dominance reflects sustained consumer trust, premium positioning, and successful diversification across hardware, software, and services. The company's brand value now constitutes approximately 12% of the total value of the BrandZ Global Top 100, which stands at &#36;10.7 trillion in 2025. 
<br />

<br />
Kantar also identifies Apple as representative of two of the fastest-growing categories in the ranking: consumer technology and luxury. According to the report, these sectors grew 46% and 45% respectively, outperforming categories such as finance, automotive, and telecoms. The report cites sustained demand for high-end devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Pro models and the Apple Watch Ultra as indicators of this dual-category positioning.
<br />

<br />
Apple's lead in the BrandZ ranking places it ahead of other major technology firms including Google (No. 2, &#36;944.1 billion), Microsoft (No. 3, &#36;884.8 billion), Amazon (No. 4, &#36;866.1 billion), and Nvidia (No. 5, &#36;509.4 billion). <br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/apple-again-named-most-valuable-brand/">Apple Again Named the World&#039;s Most Valuable Brand</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-again-named-the-worlds-most-valuable-brand.2457185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    Epic Games said today that Apple has blocked its attempt to bring Fortnite back to iOS devices, leaving the popular battle royale game unavailable on iPhones and iPads worldwide.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756080" height="720" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.5.jpg" width="1280" />
<br />
"Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union," Epic stated via its <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923293522234356169">Fortnite account</a> on X (Twitter). "Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it."
<br />

<br />
Apple banned the ‌Epic Games‌ developer account back in 2020 when ‌Epic Games‌ violated its ‌App Store‌ rules to add web-based purchases, kicking off a multi-year legal battle. Because the main ‌Epic Games‌ developer account continues to be banned, Epic submitted Fortnite to the U.S. ‌App Store‌ using an account from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/epic-games-fortnite-us-app-store/">Epic Games Sweden</a>, a subsidiary that Epic formed to create the ‌Epic Games‌ Store alternative app marketplace in the European Union.
<br />

<br />
The game was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/fortnite-submitted-to-us-app-store/">submitted for review</a> on May 9, but after waiting over 120 hours without a response, Epic was forced to pull and resubmit its application to include the latest update.
<br />

<br />
Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has been vocal about his frustration with the situation, claiming that Apple has not been returning the company's calls and that the review process <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/epic-resubmits-fortnite-to-app-store/">typically moves much faster</a>.
<br />

<br />
Before submitting Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said the company spoke with Apple about its plans – but never claimed Apple approved them. It remains unclear if Apple will allow Fortnite back, as the Epic v. Apple lawsuit confirmed that Apple has the right to ban Epic's account and isn't required to reinstate it.
<br />

<br />
It's the latest chapter in the ongoing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">legal battle</a> between the two companies, which began in 2020 when Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after Epic implemented direct payment options that bypassed Apple's 30% commission.
<br />

<br />
The game had briefly returned to iOS devices in the EU via the Epic Games Store, but that version has now also gone offline.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/">Fortnite</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/apple-blocks-fortnite-return-to-ios-app-store/">Epic: Fortnite Offline Worldwide &#039;Until Apple Unblocks It&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-fortnite-offline-worldwide-until-apple-unblocks-it.2457179/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.eu/presscentre/sony-introduces-the-next-evolution-of-noise-cancelling-with-the-wh-1000xm6">announced</a> its new <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-17086682">WH-1000XM6 wireless noise-canceling headphones</a>. The good news is that the company has brought back the foldable design that was absent from its predecessor, the WH-1000XM5. The bad news is that it's stuck with the same naming convention, which sounds less like headphones and more like a dot-matrix printer from the 70s.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001923" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
The WH-1000XM6 headphones now happily fold up into a redesigned carrying case with a magnetic closure instead of a zipper, making it more compact and travel-friendly than the XM5's. Otherwise, the overall aesthetics remain largely unchanged, but Sony claims the new model delivers significantly improved noise cancellation, a better Ambient Sound (transparency) mode, and enhanced audio quality.
<br />

<br />
Powering the enhanced noise cancellation is Sony's new HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN3, which works in conjunction with an expanded array of 12 microphones – 1.5 times more than the previous model. The company says this processor is seven times faster than its predecessor, allowing for more precise real-time noise adaptation.
<br />

<br />
Sony has also introduced several new software features, including Scene-based Listening, which automatically adjusts settings based on your activity and environment. The headphones also support LE Audio with Auracast for broadcast listening capabilities.
<br />

<br />
Battery life remains unchanged from the WH-1000XM5 at 30 hours, although Sony notes that a quick three-minute charge provides up to three hours of listening time. You can also charge this model and listen to your music at the same time. 
<br />

<br />
Sony says it has collaborated with recording engineers from prestigious studios including Sterling Sound, Battery Studios, and Coast Mastering to fine-tune the improved sound profile.
<br />

<br />
It sounds promising. The only real downer seems to be the fact that Sony has priced these cans at &#36;449.99 – &#36;50 more than the previous model. Whether the improvements justify the price jump is the main question. These are unashamedly plastic headphones, after all. <em>MacRumors</em> should have a hands-on review of Sony's latest flagship headphones soon. 
<br />

<br />
The WH-1000XM5's come in Black, Platinum Silver, and Midnight Blue, and are available to buy from the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-17086682">Sony website</a> and all the major electronics retailers.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sony/">Sony</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones/">Sony Announces WH-1000XM6 Noise-Canceling Headphones With Foldable Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sony-announces-wh-1000xm6-noise-canceling-headphones-with-foldable-design.2457178/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    Apple has stopped signing the iPadOS 17.7.7 update that was released earlier this week for devices unable to run versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, meaning that users will not be able to install the update even if they see it available in Software Update. Affected devices include the sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, the 10.5-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and the second-generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898667" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ipados-17.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
The company has not provided a reason for unsigning the update, but there are a number of reports on the MacRumors forums, Reddit, and elsewhere from users who have experienced issues logging into apps after updating their devices.
<br />

<br />
From <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/problems-with-apps-after-update.2457073/?post=33905841#post-33905841">MacRumors forums member <em>mrsmith1</em></a>:<blockquote>I have an iPad 6th generation. After the latest update 17.7.7 I’ve been having problems with certain, but not all apps. Wikipedia, Duck Duck Go, Letterboxd and others. Every time I open them it’s like the first time and I have to sign up or do a tour of the app. I can’t seem to do anything about it. Any ideas?</blockquote>
<br />
From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1kl69e3/comment/ms4219m/">Reddit user <em>National_Case748</em></a>:<blockquote>Since updating my iPad to iPadOS 17.7.7 (build 21H433), all apps (such as YouTube, X, etc.) log me out every time I close them. This issue did not happen before the update.
<br />

<br />
I’ve already tried all of the following:
<br />

<br />
<ul><li>Checked that Screen Time and Restrictions are disabled.</li>
<br />
<li>Verified that no profiles or MDM configurations are installed.</li>
<br />
<li>Made sure Safari cookies and password saving are enabled.</li>
<br />
<li>Performed a full Reset All Settings.</li>
<br />
<li>Finally, I did a complete factory reset and set up the iPad as new (not from backup).</li></ul>
<br />
Even after all this, the problem persists. Every time I open an app, it behaves as if it were freshly installed and asks me to log in again.</blockquote>Apple has presumably prevented users from updating to iPadOS 17.7.7 for the time being to address these issues and will release a new update once they have been fixed.
<br />

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    Microsoft today shared a new ad on YouTube with the tagline "we're faster than a Mac."
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953308" height="1081" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/microsoft-copilot-plus-pc.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
In the video, Microsoft says the top-end Windows PCs with Copilot+ branding are up to 58% faster than the previous-generation MacBook Air with the M3 chip, based on Cinebench 2024 multi-core CPU benchmark results. The ad is citing old figures that were reported on all the way back <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-surface-pro-faster-macbook-air/">in May 2024</a>, so take that as you will.
<br />

<br />
While the ad is using an older MacBook Air for comparison purposes, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/copilotplus-claims?tabs=amd">Microsoft's fine print</a> does say some Copilot+ PCs are still faster than even the latest MacBook Air models with the M4 chip, based on the same Cinebench 2024 benchmark.
<br />

<br />
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br />
Some of the Copilot+ PCs that were tested include Lenovo's Yoga Slim 7x with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processor, Microsoft's Surface Laptop with the Snapdragon X Elite, and HP's OmniBook Ultra 14 with AMD's Ryzen AI 9 HX 375.
<br />

<br />
While it is true that some PC chips are faster than Apple silicon chips in certain tests, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-m4-pro-and-m4-max/">said</a> the M4 family of chips continues to offer industry-leading performance per watt. This impressive power efficiency results in the MacBook Air having fast performance, long battery life, and a thin and light design without an internal fan.
<br />

<br />
In the end, using Windows over macOS remains a dealbreaker for some customers regardless.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows/">Windows</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/microsoft-were-faster-than-a-mac-ad/">Microsoft Says &#039;We&#039;re Faster Than a Mac&#039; in Latest Windows PC Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-says-were-faster-than-a-mac-in-latest-windows-pc-ad.2457150/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

                    Amazon this week is providing record low prices on multiple models of the iPad mini 7, starting at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DK3W6TV6%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a> for the 128GB Wi-Fi tablet, down from &#36;499.00. Colors on sale at this price include Purple, Space Gray, and Blue.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972028" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-feature-red-and-blue.jpg" width="1920" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>
<br />

<br />
Compared to past sales, this is a match of the best price we've ever tracked on the tablet. You can also get the 512GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 7 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DK3XT3DX%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;699.00</strong></a>, which is another &#36;99 discount and available in multiple colors.
<br />

<br />
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DK3W6TV6%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue" target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>128GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 7 for &#36;399.99</div></a></div>
<br />
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DK3XT3DX%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1" target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>512GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 7 for &#36;699.00</div></a></div>
<br />

<br />
These deals have been around for a few weeks now, and given that they are the last ones left in the iPad mini 7 lineup, they may soon disappear. This time around, we aren't tracking any deals on the 256GB Wi-Fi model, or any of the cellular tablets.
