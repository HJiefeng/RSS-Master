                    <p>Things were looking extremely difficult for technology companies just a few weeks ago. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on imports from countries around the world -- and an especially high tariff of 145% on imports from China. The move could have been disastrous for tech stocks in two ways: Higher prices in general would reduce demand for their products and services, and the higher prices on their imported parts and finished goods would increase their costs.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Dan Ives even <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/07/ives-calls-tariffs-armageddon-should-you-invest/">called the scenario "Armageddon"</a> for technology companies. But, luckily for these players and for investors, the situation has greatly improved. Since Trump's first announcement, he followed up by temporarily exempting electronics from tariffs. That was a first win for the industry. Then, just last week, the U.S. and China reached an initial trade agreement, dropping the level on imports from China to 30%.</p><p>Now, Ives says the bull case is "back on the table" for tech stocks such as <strong>Apple</strong> <span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: AAPL)</span>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, and <strong>Palantir Technologies</strong>. Let's take a closer look at the situation and consider whether now is a good time to get in on these growth players.</p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/18/ives-says-bull-case-back-on-table-apple-palantir/?source=iedfolrf0000001">Continue reading</a></p>

                    <p>The bull market roared on last year, and investors favored high growth stocks in particular -- with the idea that these sorts of players would excel in a potentially lower interest rate environment. And many of these investor favorites are involved in artificial intelligence (AI), a booming field that could drive growth well into the future.</p><p>But, amid all of this optimism, Warren Buffett began to construct a significant warning to Wall Street. The billionaire investor didn't join the crowd and buy stocks hand over fist. He selectively made some purchases -- for example, adding <strong>Constellation Brands</strong> to the <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> portfolio in the fourth quarter. But overall, he was a net seller of stocks, even reducing positions in top holdings <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Bank of America</strong> last year. And at the same time, Buffett built up a record level of cash -- and that level has marched higher into the new year, totaling more than $347 billion as of the end of the first quarter.</p><p>In that period, Buffett was a net seller of stocks for the 10th consecutive quarter, extending the billion-dollar warning into this year. Now let's take a look at history to see what stocks may do next.</p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/18/warren-buffetts-347-billion-warning-to-wall-street/?source=iedfolrf0000001">Continue reading</a></p>

Perhaps you weren't able to save as much as you'd hoped for retirement. There's a lot of uncertainty right now about tariffs and how they could increase inflation.

                    <p>The bull market may be returning. Investors in <strong>Archer Aviation</strong> <span class="ticker">(NYSE: ACHR)</span> certainly think so, with the stock shooting up close to 70% in the past month on the back of an optimistic earnings report. The upstart builder of electric air taxis is trying to disrupt the transportation market with its new Midnight aircraft and has orders from governments and corporations around the world.</p><p>However, the company is still in the certification stage and is not generating any revenue at the moment. With the stock soaring, should investors buy Archer Aviation stock below $13? Let's run the numbers and investigate further.</p><p>Electric air taxis -- sometimes called eVTOLs -- are aiming to disrupt the transportation market and alleviate traffic in large cities. There are plenty of start-ups trying to build these aircraft, with Archer Aviation being one of the leaders. With advancements in materials and electric propulsion, Archer Aviation's Midnight aircraft can theoretically safely and quietly fly a group of four people above a city, skipping the vehicle traffic below. </p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/18/archer-aviation-stock-soars-is-it-still-a-buy/?source=iedfolrf0000001">Continue reading</a></p>

The company's shares are down by 24% over this period, while the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> has gained 41%. The gene-editing specialist has, no doubt, faced some headwinds.</p><p>However, important catalysts could double its stock price by 2030. For those keeping score at home, that would amount to a compound annual growth rate of about 14.9%, well above the market's historical average returns. </p><p>CRISPR Therapeutics' focus on gene editing has some advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, its revolutionary techniques can allow researchers to create therapies for otherwise untreatable (or difficult-to-treat) conditions. CRISPR proved as much when it created and developed Casgevy, a one-time treatment that provides a functional cure for two genetic blood disorders: sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia.

Using quantum mechanics, researchers have been able to build quantum bits -- Qubits -- that can compute difficult problems exponentially faster than traditional computers. If quantum computers can be widely commercialized, it promises a revolution in computing similar to that of traditional computers.

                    <p>Despite the U.S. and China announcing a 90-day pause on elevated tariff rates against one another, there is still a 10% blanket tariff rate on imports from most of the country's major trading partners, as well as 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and some auto parts. Additionally, negotiations are ongoing and while the worst of the trade war looks to be in the past, investors are still unclear about exactly how things will shake out.</p><p>After so much market volatility, some investors may prefer to hunt for stocks that generate solid passive income. If they happen to be at least somewhat insulated from the ongoing trade war, that's even better. Here are two stocks that fit into this theme.</p><p>The massive telecommunications company <strong>Verizon</strong> <span class="ticker">(NYSE: VZ)</span> is headquartered in New York City, and made it abundantly clear in April that consumers would be on the hook for higher prices resulting from tariffs, if they were to stay at elevated rates. Long term, this may not be such a popular decision with customers, but financially it does offer some insulation from tariffs. Verizon also should have pricing power, given its well-known brand and the necessity of its offerings including internet and phone service.</p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/18/these-2-dividend-stocks-also-happen-to-be-american/?source=iedfolrf0000001">Continue reading</a></p>

                    <p>The announcement of the 90-day tariff pause with China turned into a boon for tech stocks, as the indexes spiked higher. One of the more notable cheerleaders is Dan Ives, senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities. Ives went so far as to call this a "dream scenario" for <strong>Apple </strong><span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: AAPL)</span>.</p><p>But is that truly the case?
