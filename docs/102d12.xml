an overview of <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>,

descriptions of interesting things that can be done with Home Assistant,

this closing article, we'll look at how Home Assistant was used to solve
some real problems.

<blockquote class="bq">
We are pleased to announce that our graphics driver userspace API
(uAPI) has been merged into the Linux kernel. This major milestone
allows us to finally enable OpenGL, OpenCL and Vulkan support for
Apple Silicon in upstream Mesa. This is the only time a graphics
driver's uAPI has been merged into the kernel independent of the
driver itself, which was kindly allowed by the kernel graphics
subsystem (DRM) maintainers to facilitate upstream Mesa enablement
while the required Rust abstractions make their way upstream. We are
grateful for this one-off exception, made possible with close
collaboration with the kernel community.

                    Leon Romanovsky began his session at the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory Management, and BPF Summit (LSFMM+BPF) by explaining that the improved DMA-mapping API that he has been
working on is a group effort.  He, Chaitanya Kulkarni, Christoph Hellwig,
Jason Gunthorpe, and others are proposing to modernize the API and to
"<q>make it more suitable for current kernels</q>".  He told the assembled
storage and filesystem developers that the progress on the proposal has
stalled, but that it was the basis for further work in various areas, so he
hoped to find a way to move forward with it.

                <![CDATA[
                    
                    <p>The Tor project has <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-oniux-tor-isolation-using-linux-namespaces/">announced</a>
the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/oniux#oniux">oniux</a> utility which provides Tor network isolation, using Linux
namespaces, for third-party applications.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Namespaces are a powerful feature that gives us the ability to
isolate Tor network access of an arbitrary application. We put each
application in a network namespace that doesn't provide access to
system-wide network interfaces (such as eth0), and instead provides a
custom network interface onion0.</p>

<p>This allows us to isolate an arbitrary application over Tor in the
most secure way possible software-wise, namely by relying on a
security primitive offered by the operating system kernel. Unlike
SOCKS, the application cannot accidentally leak data by failing to
make some connection via the configured SOCKS, which may happen due to
a mistake by the developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Tor project cautions that oniux is considered experimental as
the software it depends on, such as <a href="https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/arti/about">Arti</a> and
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/onionmasq#onionmasq---masquerading-onions">onionmasq</a>,
are still new.</p>

                    <p>At the <a href="https://linuxappsummit.org/">Linux Application
Summit</a> (LAS) in April, Sebastian Wick said that, by many metrics, <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> is doing great. The Flatpak
application-packaging format is popular with upstream developers, and
with many users. More and more applications are being published in the
<a href="https://flathub.org/">Flathub</a> application store, and the
format is even being adopted by Linux distributions like
Fedora. However, he worried that work on the Flatpak project itself
had stagnated, and that there were too few developers able to review
and merge code beyond basic maintenance.</p>

From
servers in a data center to desktop computers, many devices
communicating on a network will eventually have to filter network
traffic, whether it's for security or performance reasons. As a result,
this is a domain where a lot of work is put into improving performance:
a tiny performance improvement can have considerable gains.

Bpfilter</a> is a
project that allows for packet filtering to easily be done with BPF, which can
be faster than other mechanisms.
