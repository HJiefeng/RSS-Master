                    <p>Back in 2017, engineers at Meta sought to create a type checker for Instagram&#8217;s typed Python codebase. Years later, as the type system continued to evolve, that type checker eventually became Pyrefly.Â  Pyrefly is a new type checker and IDE experience for Python, written with Rust, and now available for the entire Python community to [...]</p>
