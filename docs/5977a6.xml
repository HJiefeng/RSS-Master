As many of us have already believed, Apple was caught off-guard by the new generative AI trend.</p>



<p>Additionally, according to Gurman, Apple is ‘unlikely’ to spend a lot of time talking about Siri at this years WWDC. That includes future upgrades and the already announced (but since delayed) features from last years WWDC.</p>

Instead, he reiterates that new  with Infrared cameras are set to arrive in 2026.</p>



<p>This contradicts reporting from other publications that have suggested AirPods Pro 3 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/27/airpods-pro-3-much-better-noise-cancelation/">will launch in 2025</a>, including new features such as improved active noise cancellation. </p>

Apple revised the headphones last fall, adding a USB-C port, but the model was otherwise unchanged. Despite costing the most, AirPods Max lack features that are available in even the cheapest AirPods 4, and are driven by the outdated H1 chip. </p>



<p>And if you believe analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, you’ve still got a while to wait before Apple will be ready to release a next-generation model. <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1924150858549514640">In a tweet</a>, Kuo reports that next-generation AirPods Max will not arrive until 2027. </p>

These are non-Apple tech products I rely on every day.</p>

<p>While this does feel like a weird decision, it will have some noteworthy benefits for all iPhone users.</p>

<p>I have an AirTag on my keychain to keep track of my keys, but obviously an AirTag is too big and bulky to fit inside a wallet. That’s what the  is for. </p>



<p>Disguised inside a thin, credit-card form factor, the SwitchBot Wallet Finder connects to the Find My app on your iPhone, so you can follow its location, and it even houses a speaker so you can make it beep to help you find your wallet when it inevitably gets lost somewhere in your home. Read on for my review …</p>

That’s because Apple charges an insane $800 for the upgrade, turning the budget $600 computer into a $1400 one. In other words, you can purchase two base model Mac minis for less than the price of a single Mac mini with a 2TB upgrade.</p>



<p>But fret not, because <a href="https://expandmacmini.com">Expand Mac mini</a> offers a <strong>2TB upgrade for the M4 Mac mini </strong>for just $320 – <em>less than half</em> of what Apple charges. In this hands-on step-by-step video walkthrough, I show you how to upgrade the M4 Mac mini SSD with 2TB of storage.

<p>Sometimes, the difference is subtle. Sometimes, not so much. Sometimes, it’s downright dangerous, as shown in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043">this</a> 2023 Carnegie Mellon study, which found that non-English inputs could more easily bypass safety filters.</p>



<p>Now, Apple has co-authored a study proposing a new method that could close part of this gap.</p>

Apple is even working on its <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/24/apples-new-home-products-key-upgrade-big-difference/">own Bluetooth and Wi-Fi solution</a>, which is reportedly coming with new Home products and the iPhone 17 lineup in the Fall.</p>



<p>One obvious benefit of developing chips in-house is energy efficiency. Apple toated this with the introduction of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-silicon/page/2/">Apple Silicon</a> what feels like a hundred years ago, and with its latest C1 modem, which gives the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16-e-now-available/">iPhone 16e</a> nearly <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-beats-apples-more-expensive-iphone-16-in-one-big-way/">20% better battery life</a> over the flagship iPhone 16. While improved battery life is certainly appealing, there are less obvious and possibly more significant benefits of Apple having end-to-end control over both the software and hardware components.</p>

<p>The original post is below, but we encourage readers to cross-reference its claims with other sources. </p>

<p>Based on more than 200 interviews with former <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Apple</a> execs and engineers, Patrick McGee’s <em></em> ought to leave Tim Cook laying awake at night. It makes a convincing argument that the iPhone could be killed overnight should the Chinese government wish it.</p>



<p>This is a book reminiscent of Walter Isaacson’s <em>Steve Jobs</em> in its careful research and the detailed inside stories it tells about Apple. The company’s official line is that it’s full of inaccuracies, but the case it makes is an incredibly persuasive one …</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/09/no-fortnite-on-u-s-app-store-yet-but-epic-still-targeting-release-this-week/">Epic Games announced</a> that it had submitted Fortnite to the App Store in the United States. The move followed an injunction in which a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-sanctioned-for-defying-court-order-over-app-store-rules/">federal judge said Apple couldn’t</a> charge a 27% commission on out-of-app purchases initiated through in-app links. </p>



<p>In a new statement today, however, Epic says that Apple has “blocked” this submission…</p>

What might be the most anticipated pair of headphones in the last year has finally arrived as a follow up to some of the most cherished over-ear ANC cans in the business. This time around featuring a new, faster processor, enhanced noise cancellation, even better call quality with upgraded AI noise reduction, and a nicer, more compact design, the question is whether or not all of this and another jump in price will have fans trading out their beloved XM5s (or something from the other brands) for the new XM6.</p>

<p>This message has been live in the App Store since the beginning of Apple’s DMA compliance efforts <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/05/ios-17-4-now-available/">in March 2024</a>. </p>



<p>In August 2024, Apple announced multiple changes to its compliance plan – including a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-the-eu/#user-disclosures">change to the disclosure message</a> that appears in the App Store for apps that do not use Apple’s In-App Purchase system. Apple proposed updating the disclosure to read: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Transactions in this app are supported by the developer and not Apple.</p>



<p>Learn more</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The proposal also changed the design of the disclosure message, replacing the bright red “!” icon with a less aggressive gray “i” icon, as you can see below. </p>



<p>Apple tells <em>9to5Mac</em> it was ready to implement the changes and that the EU took no issue with the updated disclosure sheet. According to Apple, however, the EU requested the company <em>not </em>implement the changes at that time and never followed up with further guidance. It <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/23/apple-fined-500-million-euros-digital-markets-act/">then fined Apple $500 million for noncompliance</a> last month.</p>



<p>Apple’s comments today align with a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/08/apple-tried-addressing-eus-concerns-in-2024-but-was-stonewalled-report/">report from <em>Politico </em>last week</a>, which said Apple tried addressing the EU’s concerns last summer but was stonewalled. </p>

<p>Now, Netflix has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/netflix-ad-tier-monthly-active-users.html">shared some data</a> that indicates that while many might object to an ad-supported tier, they’re watching it anyway.</p>
