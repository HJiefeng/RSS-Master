It was my favorite song for at least a week, and it&#8217;s still in my top 10 (something by Rush likely displaced it.) As a teenager, I knew everything about AC/DC (at least everything you could know before [&#8230;]</p>

                    <p>Now that I&#8217;m out of hibernation for a while and back in Boulder for a month, I&#8217;m doing a bunch of public events. My approach, in general, is fireside chats or AMAs, so that&#8217;ll be the rhythm rather than me getting up in front of a crowd and blathering about something for 30 to 45 [&#8230;]</p>

                    <p>Question: If you had limited experience with graphic design software but wanted to do basic stuff for web design, what software would you use? Leave the answers in the comments or email me. As I play around with Vibe coding, I&#8217;ve decided to take a new topic each week. For context, look at my Dinostroids: [&#8230;]</p>

                    <p>I had a weird, unsatisfying, and not particularly restful weekend because of Colorado politics and post-exertional malaise. So, in between work, a short run, a long nap, a bunch of online Swedish death cleaning, and lying on the couch responding to endless text messages, I read Carrie Soto Is Back and The Big Gamble (Kevin [&#8230;]</p>
